      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        Archaeologists working at the Xochitécatl site have uncovered a new mural depicting symbolic elements 
        of local mythology. The painting, discovered on the interior wall of a partially excavated temple, 
        features vibrant pigments and intricate iconography.
      </p>
      <p>
        Initial dating places the mural around the 7th century CE, suggesting it may predate 
        similar artworks found at nearby Cacaxtla. This finding could reshape our understanding 
        of artistic influences and cultural exchange during that era.

      <h2>Significance</h2>
      <p>
        Experts believe that the imagery on the mural includes representations of deities 
        associated with fertility and rain. Its style and color palette show parallels with 
        existing murals at Cacaxtla, indicating a shared or connected artistic tradition.
      </p>
      <p>
        The discovery offers a rare glimpse into the spiritual and social life of the people 
        who once inhabited Xochitecatl. Conservation efforts are already underway, ensuring 
        that the mural’s colors remain intact for future research and public viewing.

      <h2>Next Steps</h2>
      <p>
        Over the coming months, a dedicated team will carefully clean and stabilize the painting. 
        Plans are in motion to create a 3D digital model for ongoing study and to share the find with 
        the public. Once stabilized, the site may open for limited tours under supervision of INAH experts.
